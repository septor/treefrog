# TreeFrog

discord.js bot written for the CherryTree Discord Community

## I want to test!

You need to do the following:

* [Join my dumb Discord server.](https://discord.gg/fFbf5wbD4D)
* Let me know who you are from the CherryTree server, unless it's obvious.
* Promise to try and break things.
* Promise to give me ideas on how to make things better.

## I want to contribute!

* Clone the repo, fix or include new things (one item at a time, please).
* Submit a pull request. If you close an issue, please indicate it.

Primary focus is the `!vault` command. Let me know on Discord if you're working on something!

You can also check out the [issues section](https://github.com/septor/treefrog/issues).

## I don't code, how can I help with data!

Glad you asked! With the commit that change the README file, I've added an `items.json` file! This will be used for commands down the road, and possibly even sites like [CherryQuick](https://septor.xyz/cherryquick/). I need help filling in the data. The `id` field there is the ID found on the Wiki. I have some data added already, but it's a long process that takes away from other development.
