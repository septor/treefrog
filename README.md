discord.js bot written for the CherryTree Discord Community

## I want to test!

You need to do the following:

1. Head to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create a new bot.
2. Rename `example.config.json` into `config.json` and update the values. `allowedChannels` expects channel IDs. `userAccessLevels` expects user IDs. Default user level is `low`, which does not need to be set.
3. Take the TOKEN (found under the Bot category) you are given while creating your bot and place it inside a `.env` file: `TOKEN:YOURTOKENHERE`.
4. You need `Read Messages History`, `Send Messages`, and possibly `Send Messages in Threads` permissions.
5. Open the directory in a terminal and type `npm init`.
6. Install all the needed pacakges: `npm install`.
7. To start the bot, I recommend setting up `pm2`, but that's up to you. You can use `npm start .` otherwise.

See below if you want to contribute to the progress of the bot going forward.

## I want to contribute!

Primary focus is the `!vault` command. Let me know on Discord if you're working on something!
